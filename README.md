# What is this?

Here are the notebooks I made to keep notes while I read the book An introduction to mathematical cryptography - Second edition by Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher and Joseph H. Silverman

## What do the notebooks contain?
* Explaination of concepts in the book
* Algorithms in the book
* Extra resources for intuition sprinkled here and there
* No exercices  



## Prerequisites
Since I had the following knowledge from different courses I didn't bother to explain all the concepts
* Basic Linear Algebra
* Probability Theory
* Group Theory
* Information Theory

^ I also added handwritten notes with more theory from the book reagrding these (sorry if I write horribly)  
Use them to follow along

## What programming language did you use?
* Python mainly
* Sage for more complex algorithms

## Are these state of the art implementations?
No

## Is this finished?
No, I still have to implement a few algorithms here and there
